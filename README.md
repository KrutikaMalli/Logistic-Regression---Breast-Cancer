# Logistic-Regression : Breast Cancer prediction 

#### This Project is used to predict the likeliness of Breast cancer by determining the class of tumor that is if it's Malignant or Benign.
* Malignant tumor indicates the occurence of Breast cancer.
* Here, in this dataset: Benign is 2, Malignant is 4 in Class column.
* Have performed Logistic Regression to classify the dependable variable i.e class based on various independent factors such as Clump thickness, Uniformity of cell size, Cell shape, Cell nuclei, etc.
* After performing the regression, have attained the Accuracy of 96.70% and Standard deviation of 1.97% for this dataset.
